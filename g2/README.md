# Welcome to the ASP.NET WebAPI Subject
Welcome to the ASP.NET WebAPI Subject. Through out this subject we will learn to create an end-to end web application, but without UI. Tis application acts as a service to other applications or maybe a separate UI component. The web applications will be built with the ASP.NET framework for building WebAPI applications. We will use C# and MSSQL to create the application. At the end of this course you will be able to implement a complete WebAPI solutionsl. 
## Prerequisites for this Subject ðŸ—º
1. Knowledge of C# and it's features
2. Knowledge of ASP.NET MVC and its features
3. Knowledge of manipulating databases using MSSQL
4. Installed Visual Studio 2017
